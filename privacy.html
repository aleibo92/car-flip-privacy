  <h1>Privacy Policy – Car Flip Profit Calculator</h1>
  <small>Last updated: <!-- replace with date --> March 29, 2025</small>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Car Flip Profit Calculator</strong> (“the Extension”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Chrome extension <strong>Car Flip Profit Calculator</strong>, and</li>
    <li>Our backend API used by the extension for parts pricing and Stripe checkout.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By using the Extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>a. Car &amp; Flip Details (User Input)</h3>
  <p>When you use the Extension, you can enter:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Year, make, model, and mileage</li>
    <li>Vehicle condition</li>
    <li>Known issues / parts needed</li>
    <li>Purchase price and planned sale price</li>
    <li>Optional listing URL (e.g., Facebook Marketplace / Craigslist)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is used to estimate repair costs, estimate resale value, calculate potential profit, and show or save your flip history.
  </p>

  <h3>b. Backend Requests</h3>
  <p>
    When the Extension calls our backend API, it may send:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Car details (year, make, model)</li>
    <li>Parts/issue names you enter</li>
    <li>Sale price amount and description (for Stripe payment sessions)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Our server may log basic request data for debugging and security, such as request time, request body, and IP address. We do not use this data to build user profiles or for advertising.
  </p>

  <h3>c. Payment Information (via Stripe)</h3>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Stripe</strong> to handle payments. We do not process or store your full credit card number on our servers. Payment details are handled directly by Stripe in their secure checkout page, and Stripe may collect additional information according to their own privacy policy.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>We use the information you provide to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculate estimated repair costs and profit</li>
    <li>Generate parts cost estimates via our backend</li>
    <li>Create Stripe Checkout sessions so you can accept payment for a flip</li>
    <li>Display your saved flip history inside the Extension</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your data to third parties.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
  <h3>a. In the Extension (Local)</h3>
  <p>
    The Extension may store your flip history (recent calculations, car details, profit, listing URL) locally in your browser. This data stays on your device. You can clear it by removing the extension or clearing its data/storage.
  </p>

  <h3>b. On Our Backend</h3>
  <p>
    Our backend may temporarily log car &amp; parts data, payment session data, and standard server logs (IP, user agent, timestamps, errors). We use these logs only for debugging, monitoring abuse/security, and improving reliability. We do not store card numbers or full payment details; Stripe handles those.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We rely on third-party services to operate:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stripe</strong> – payment processing</li>
    <li><strong>Hosting provider</strong> (e.g., Render) – hosting the backend API and any static pages</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub / GitHub Pages</strong> – hosting code and possibly this privacy policy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These third parties have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for their practices, but we try to choose reputable providers.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension itself does not use cookies or tracking pixels. Our backend does not run ads or third-party trackers. Stripe and hosting providers may use their own cookies or similar technologies as part of their services.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with information, please contact us so we can remove it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect information, including using HTTPS for communication, using Stripe for secure payment processing, and limiting the data we collect. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remove or disable the Extension at any time</li>
    <li>Clear the Extension’s data via your browser settings</li>
    <li>Choose not to use the Stripe payment features</li>
    <li>Avoid entering any personal information into free-form fields (such as the listing URL)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top. Your continued use of the Extension after any changes means you accept the updated policy.
  </p>
